          We a <b>nonprofit</b> dedicated in serving <b>today's youth</b> and{" "}

          The Youth Arts Movement is focused on{" "}
          <b>providing a platform for your voice</b> through music, art,
          literature, and all aspects of the arts.

          Based in a community very much influenced in STEM, we saw the arts
          develop a stigma of instability and unintelligence. Weâ€™ve all been
          there, your poetry award or art prize never seemed to stack up against
          a robotics championship. YAM strives to{" "}
          <b>close this gap between the STEAM field and the arts</b>,
          emphasizing the importance of both in our society today.

        <p>
          YAM provides students with opportunities to{" "}
          <b>elevate their artwork and their own voices</b>. YAM competitions
          provides winners with scholarship prizes, applicants with connections,
          and communities with fundraisers and donations.
