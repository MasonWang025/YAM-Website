              {tab}Here at YAM, we want to provide opportunities for other young artists and <b>create a tangible positive impact in our communities.</b> Thanks to our numerous <b>partners and sponsorships,</b> we have the ability to accomplish that. Here are some projects weâ€™re working on at the moment:

                <h2>Arts Made Accessible (AMA)</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to support young artists and showcase their artwork. However, not every student has access to the resources needed for quality art exploration and education. We seek to supplement such students with the opportunities they do not have access to. With the aid of our various partnerships and sponsors, we are able to provide basic art materials to students across the country.
