    description:
      "My pieces are inspired by portraits of people I know. I used graphite and watercolor of my pieces because watercolor brings out the color and character of the piece, while graphite helps bring out the depth and structure of the human face. I believe that applying knowledge from real-life to paper is important because it helps you identify unique characteristics that a person might possess, helps you to identify simple structures of the face, learn human proportions, and learn about the reflection of light/shadows. I also believe that shading is a challenge in the art world because it comes in many forms and is one of the most important elements that help bring your art piece to life and emulate the structure of your piece.",

    title: "Face of a Revolution",
    description:
      "My piece is called “Face of a Revolution.” It is a portrait of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, often stylized as AOC for short. In America, it is no secret that our government works for big businesses and the top 1% and not the working class Americans who live from paycheck to paycheck. Our politicians and government officials are funded by big dollar corporations and consequently represent special interests over the needs of the American people. Because of this, issues like wealth disparity and systemic racism prosper under our corrupt, broken government. However, there is hope for change. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not a career politician. She grew up in the Bronx, an area in which your zip code determines whether or not you make it in life. Before running for office, she was a bartender. As such, she understands the harsh obstacles that working class Americans face everyday. She refuses all corporate donations, and is 100% funded for the people, living by the mantra that a government should be of the people, by the people, and for the people. She is seen by many as the face of the modern progressive movement, championing human-centric policies to challenge the corruption in Washington D.C. AOC is one of the few politicians who truly represents the 99% of Americans who are not millionaires and billionaires, leading the fight for universal healthcare, free tuition to public universities, and a Green New Deal. The painting itself is meant to exude hope- hope for a better future and a better America. The background is a blend of white with different shades of blue and red. These two colors, of course, represent the two dominant political parties of our country, the Democratic and Republican parties. While Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez identifies as a Democrat, she is determined to help rebuild a government that unifies the people and works for everyone.",

    title: "Current",
    description:
      "This piece titled “Current” is roughly 22×30 inches and it is for graduating an art studio I’ve gone to for a large part of my life. It is a mixed media piece with marker, pastel, watercolor, acrylic, ink, and gold leaf. The girl in the middle symbolizes who I am. To break it down, her dress merges into my old art pieces and a wolf’s tail, meaning that my past struggles and effort is always part of what my art is today. You can see her drawing the end of the wolf’s tail— which symbolizes that despite artistic expression being such a scary thing for me, it also protects me and makes me feel comfortable and safe. A lot of the other smaller components are for visuals. This piece took me around 15 hours, and it really emphasizes that artists use a ton of effort to create something they’re proud of and it takes years for them to build themselves up in order to be proud and keep improving. It challenges the misconception that art is easy and effortless and really points out the journey an artist takes.",

    description:
      "The piece is called “Number 6.” It is an homage to a member of the 12-member Kpop group known as LOONA. It is an oil painting that is meant to display a futuristic, ethereal concept, characterized by high saturation and vibrance. The artist in the painting, Kim Lip, debuted 6th out of all 12 members with the hit-single, “Eclipse,” a K R&B masterpiece. The painting is aesthetically regal in order to match the concept of this particular member. She is engulfed in a warm lighting which is a reference to her representative color, red.",

    description:
      "A pastel drawing of a river landscape. This was also my first attempt at using pastels, which can be fun to use in blending colors, but on the other hand, mistakes can’t be completely erased. For a first attempt, I certainly found it difficult, and the drawing shows my initial struggle (bottom half) and progression to familiarity with the style (top half).",

    description:
      "A creative experiment for me, where I created a set of plants in vivid colors against a dark background. I created this using a plastic sheet. I painted one side with a plethora of bright colors, and slathered ink on the opposite side. Using a stick, I scratched the images into the dried ink to create the piece. I had no idea where this particular project would go, but it appeared to be a success.",

    description:
      "This piece is titled “Kids Play, Parents Protect.” This is an artwork I created for a project about “Growth.” The baby elephant represents kids while the adult elephants represent adults. The earthquake in my artwork is a representation of a disaster or a problem in life. The baby elephant, unaware of what is going on, continues playing with his soccer ball. My artwork includes utility poles falling and the adult elephants blocks it from hitting the baby. This artwork symbolizes that people grow and come to realize they are responsible for more things they never have to care about as a child. A child depends on others to be protected and is unaware of dangers. Overtime, they will have to take over their parent’s job of protecting a child. Everyone will come to a time when there are people or things that they love and cherish, and that is when they learn about responsibilities and protection.",
