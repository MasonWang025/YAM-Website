I used graphite and watercolor of my pieces because watercolor brings out the color and character of the piece, while graphite helps bring out the depth and structure of the human face. I believe that applying knowledge from real-life to paper is important because it helps you identify unique characteristics that a person might possess, helps you to identify simple structures of the face, learn human proportions, and learn about the reflection of light/shadows. I also believe that shading is a challenge in the art world because it comes in many forms and is one of the most important elements that help bring your art piece to life and emulate the structure of your piece.",

    description:
      "This piece titled “Current” is roughly 22×30 inches and it is for graduating an art studio I’ve gone to for a large part of my life. It is a mixed media piece with marker, pastel, watercolor, acrylic, ink, and gold leaf. The girl in the middle symbolizes who I am. To break it down, her dress merges into my old art pieces and a wolf’s tail, meaning that my past struggles and effort is always part of what my art is today. You can see her drawing the end of the wolf’s tail— which symbolizes that despite artistic expression being such a scary thing for me, it also protects me and makes me feel comfortable and safe. A lot of the other smaller components are for visuals. This piece took me around 15 hours, and it really emphasizes that artists use a ton of effort to create something they’re proud of and it takes years for them to build themselves up in order to be proud and keep improving. It challenges the misconception that art is easy and effortless and really points out the journey an artist takes.",

It is an oil painting that is meant to display a futuristic, ethereal concept, characterized by high saturation and vibrance. The artist in the painting, Kim Lip, debuted 6th out of all 12 members with the hit-single, “Eclipse,” a K R&B masterpiece. The painting is aesthetically regal in order to match the concept of this particular member. She is engulfed in a warm lighting which is a reference to her representative color, red.",

      "This piece is titled “Kids Play, Parents Protect.” This is an artwork I created for a project about “Growth.” The baby elephant represents kids while the adult elephants represent adults. The earthquake in my artwork is a representation of a disaster or a problem in life. The baby elephant, unaware of what is going on, continues playing with his soccer ball. My artwork includes utility poles falling and the adult elephants blocks it from hitting the baby. This artwork symbolizes that people grow and come to realize they are responsible for more things they never have to care about as a child. A child depends on others to be protected and is unaware of dangers. Overtime, they will have to take over their parent’s job of protecting a child. Everyone will come to a time when there are people or things that they love and cherish, and that is when they learn about responsibilities and protection.",

        You are not left.
        <br />
        You are not right.
        <br />
        You are granted. <br />
        <br />
        You should be granted to every human being the moment they descend onto
        the planet. You should see my soul, just like every other soul out
        there, a colorless spirit. You come, drop off what you need, and that's
        it. <br />
        <br />
        We should take you for granted. This is something every human being
        deserves. <br />
        <br />
        But then, why am I here, searching for you? You aren't present. Like
        what my teacher used to say when I wouldn't respond to the
        mispronunciation of my name. There's nothing to take for granted,
        because, well, I was granted nothing. <br />
        <br />I am here, scrounging around with nothing but the change in my
        pocket and the hope in my heart, looking for you. I am here, seeking to
        find you, all by myself. I am here, on a path of self-discovery, trying
        to locate the vital thing I need to make my life worth living. <br />
        <br />
        This tiring, endless journey has brought me to where you are supposed to
        be. Among the blue uniforms, shiny badges, and armed black waistbands.
        Correcting the wrong, trapping the bad, removing the evil. Inside the
        gray building, with its unforgiving, sharp edges, sterile glass windows,
        and manicured front lawn. After all these miles and all this time, is
        this the place that I've been waiting for? <br />
        <br />I am here, waiting for you. No matter how hard I must fight, or
        how demeaning the pain is to endure, I will remain at this very place,
        anticipating the day you come. <br />
        <br />
        You may be written on paper or talked about by our leaders, but that is
        not enough. You must be embedded into the people and be at the core of
        our beings. <br />
        <br />
        The consciousness is leaving my body, the lethargy is taking over. I am
        stuck, not an ounce of energy left. I reach and reach, but there's
        nothing left.
