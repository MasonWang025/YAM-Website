    description:
      "My pieces are inspired by portraits of people I know. I used graphite and watercolor of my pieces because watercolor brings out the color and character of the piece, while graphite helps bring out the depth and structure of the human face. I believe that applying knowledge from real-life to paper is important because it helps you identify unique characteristics that a person might possess, helps you to identify simple structures of the face, learn human proportions, and learn about the reflection of light/shadows. I also believe that shading is a challenge in the art world because it comes in many forms and is one of the most important elements that help bring your art piece to life and emulate the structure of your piece.",

    title: "Current",
    description:
      "This piece titled “Current” is roughly 22×30 inches and it is for graduating an art studio I’ve gone to for a large part of my life. It is a mixed media piece with marker, pastel, watercolor, acrylic, ink, and gold leaf. The girl in the middle symbolizes who I am. To break it down, her dress merges into my old art pieces and a wolf’s tail, meaning that my past struggles and effort is always part of what my art is today. You can see her drawing the end of the wolf’s tail— which symbolizes that despite artistic expression being such a scary thing for me, it also protects me and makes me feel comfortable and safe. A lot of the other smaller components are for visuals. This piece took me around 15 hours, and it really emphasizes that artists use a ton of effort to create something they’re proud of and it takes years for them to build themselves up in order to be proud and keep improving. It challenges the misconception that art is easy and effortless and really points out the journey an artist takes.",

    description:
      "The piece is called “Number 6.” It is an homage to a member of the 12-member Kpop group known as LOONA. It is an oil painting that is meant to display a futuristic, ethereal concept, characterized by high saturation and vibrance. The artist in the painting, Kim Lip, debuted 6th out of all 12 members with the hit-single, “Eclipse,” a K R&B masterpiece. The painting is aesthetically regal in order to match the concept of this particular member. She is engulfed in a warm lighting which is a reference to her representative color, red.",

For a first attempt, I certainly found it difficult, and the drawing shows my initial struggle (bottom half) and progression to familiarity with the style (top half).",

I painted one side with a plethora of bright colors, and slathered ink on the opposite side. Using a stick, I scratched the images into the dried ink to create the piece. I had no idea where this particular project would go, but it appeared to be a success.",

    description:
      "This piece is titled “Kids Play, Parents Protect.” This is an artwork I created for a project about “Growth.” The baby elephant represents kids while the adult elephants represent adults. The earthquake in my artwork is a representation of a disaster or a problem in life. The baby elephant, unaware of what is going on, continues playing with his soccer ball. My artwork includes utility poles falling and the adult elephants blocks it from hitting the baby. This artwork symbolizes that people grow and come to realize they are responsible for more things they never have to care about as a child. A child depends on others to be protected and is unaware of dangers. Overtime, they will have to take over their parent’s job of protecting a child. Everyone will come to a time when there are people or things that they love and cherish, and that is when they learn about responsibilities and protection.",
